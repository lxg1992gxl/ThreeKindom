I submit the following for assessment as my best class.


The method allNextStepPossibilities() in class AIstrategies():
    It expands one layer in "Minimax" tree. Main idea for Advanced AI. Will be used recursively to get the final best move.

The method getFlags() in class WarringStatesGame():
    It calculates the flag conditions after each move, and do a large loop.
    The structure of this task is the standard form to update board and to use in further AI part.


I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:


The idea of <...> came from a discussion with <...>
The code in class <...> uses an idea suggested by <...>
