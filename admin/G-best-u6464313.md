My best code is the method highlightMouse in Game.java

It allowed the card be selected by a red or green rectangle(actually a rec lower layer), and moves with the mouse movement.
when the mouse hoving on a valid move, the rectangle will be green, otherwise will be red.

Most of my contribution are javafx and bugs fixing, so this method is the best code of mine.
I declare that this is entirely my own work
