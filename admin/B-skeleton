[Program File] WarringStatesGame:

(Task 2 -- finished) isCardPlaceWellFormed: 
use if-statement to check whether each position of the three-character placement string is in the correct range. 
(directly use ">, <, >=, …" to compare each other)


(Task 3 -- finished) isPlacementWellFormed: 
can construct each possible character index from different country. 
Use loop to check each set of three characters in the whole string. 
Once a person or a position appears, delete it from the initial constructed array, 
so that we ensure no duplicate at the same time.


(Task 5) isMoveLegal:
Try construct a “relationship” among “char” positions in the same line and “char” positions in the same row,
to make the comparison among cards in these positions more easily.

First check if Zhang Yi (only focusing on the 3rd element) and the chosen goal position is in the same line. 
Then, get the card code (2 characters) on the given move position. 
Find the 1st element of the code (representing the country) 
and check whether any further card in the same line has the same 1st code. 
If yes, return “false”.


(Task 6) isMoveSequenceValid:
Linked it with Task5. 
From the initial setup board, check whether each move in the moveSequence is valid itself. 
Use loop to go through all moves and update the current board at the same time. 


(Task 7) getSupporters:
Similar to some of the Task5 work. 
Given a move and the current board, first get the card ID at the goal position, 
and then get the 1st element of the got card ID. 
Through the 3rd element of the placement, find cards between Zhang Yi and the goal position. 
Check the 1st element of these cards -- whether they have the same country representative. 
If yes, return the supporters ID
 (i.e. 1st and 2nd element from corresponding part of the initial board placement string).
 
p.s. the method to get the 1st, 2nd and 3rd element from the “board setup” string can be the same as loop used in Task3.


(Task 8) getFlags:
The whole large function will be a loop, and how many moves will turn back to a loop depends on the number of players. 
Player ID will be the return value of this loop function.

Because once one person gets a chess from the board, the player can keep it until the end of the game. 
We need to construct another array (int p1 =  new int[7]) for each player, 
representing the current chess they have for each country.

After each move, get the 1st element to see which country the card belongs. 
Add the number of card we get into the corresponding players array into the corresponding position 
(e.g. if Qi, p1[1] = … if Zhao, p1[3] = …) 
Compare the numbers of the same position (i.e. flags from the same country) among different players’ array, 
and if the updated number is (one of) the largest, 
the player ID will be updated to the corresponding country array.

Keep this update operation until the left “moveSequence” length becomes 0.


(Task 10) generateMove:	
The most standard way is to check all moves one after another: 
(1) still left on the board; 
(2) are on the same row or column as card “Zhang Yi” (-- 4 directions). 
Check whether each move is valid (according to the requirements) 
using several functions we constructed in earlier tasks.

(Task 4) makePlacement:
Mostly use JavaFX knowledge, can referred to corresponding lecture codes.


[Program File] Game:

(Task 9 – basic working game & Task 11 – computer opponent & Task 12 – good computer opponent):

For the whole assignment structure, 
check whether there is no any other possible cards covered in Zhang Yi’s row and column 
is actually the first thing we need to check at the very beginning. 
Thus to save further useless check for the special “game end” situation.

When the game ends, use if-else statement -- 
first check whether there exists someone appears highest numbers on the getFlags arrays (represented in Task 8). 
If two people have same number of flags in this case, 
check the player ID in “Qin” array – the player is the winner.

***************************************

The flow of playing (and about what data in and out while playing)

Before the game start (preparations)
1. Generate a string represent all the seven kingdom supporters and Zhang Yi. (e.g, f1Az9Bc4De1Ea4Gb4If2J...)
    i: Should be randomly arranged 3*36 characters, but generate it follow the rules of Task2.
2. Check the placement well-formed. (Maybe by run Task 3 for once)
3. Make sure how many players in game.
    i: We should give an input box before the game start, and give the result to param "numPlayers".
    ii: This number may also cause different width of score board on the right side of GUI.
4. GUI should have a placement input box to get player decision at the bottom. (seems already have in Viewer.java)
    i: Send this placement to param "placement" and will be used afterwords.

Game start
During the  player's turn(this area can be a loop)

1. Input (send it to param "locationChar")
2. Check "isMoveLegal"
    i:  If illegal, tell player need try again(show something on GUI?);
    ii: If legal, then continue;
3. Check "getSupporters" to figure out what play got.
    i: May need a array to store the supporters each "playerId" have.
4. Check "getFlags" to update the array containing the player ID who controls each kingdom.
    i: May need a function to renew if a player own maximum supporters in that country. We can say that country "belongs" to "playerId".
5. Run "generateMove" to return a char indicate the destination of Zhang Yi this turn.
6. Check if game is over.
    i: If "generateMove" return null, end the game in some way.
7. GUI operations
    i: Eliminate all the cards (Supporters) which Zhang gathered.
    ii: Move this card to score board, upper the name of current player.
    iii: Move card Zhang Yi to its destination.
    iv: (If necessary) Change 7 kingdoms' flag to the maximum supporters players.
    v:: Allow next player to input next placement.(If game is over, then skip this line)

End of this game
When no further legal move can be made.

1. Show a notice to player, like " No legal move available, game over".
2. Check who win the game, output the "playerId".
3. Show a notice to player, can be "Congratulations! playerId win the game!"
4. (If necessary) To whom wants to confirm everyone's score,
    try to show score board clearly, at least don't block it with these characters.
5. (If necessary) Set a "Restart" button to start a new game.
